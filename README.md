<p>
  HALO! I'm existing as a <strong>Software and Data Science Engineering</strong> student, currently feeding my <strong>Cybersecurity</strong> curiosity at INSA Centre Val de Loire in France. I have a bit of an obsession with learning more and more and more about <strong>Java</strong> (seriously, it's a problem ðŸ˜…), though Iâ€™m still a newbie at it! If you have any new articles or functionalities to share, feel free to hit me up.
